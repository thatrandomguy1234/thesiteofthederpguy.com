            Official Instruct+ website. Instruct+ is an easy to use low level programming language that can't do much.
            If can just be used to connect to your operating system's terminal, make directories, remove directories and that's it.
            This is true for the Version 1 of Intruct+. Version 2 is still in the workings.
